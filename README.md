### eClassGradeCalculator.user.js

Calculates your grade based on "Relative Weight" and "Contribution to course total" columns. Sometimes these columns are populated without your grade being revealed, but doing easy math gets us the answer. Probably could be easily extended to work with moodle in general, but I don't care.
