[userscripts](https://greasyfork.org/en/help/installing-user-scripts) and [userstyles](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/Usercss)  I find useful

## userscripts

### eClassGradeCalculator.user.js [![Install](https://img.shields.io/badge/userscript-install-blue)](https://github.com/Mattwmaster58/userscripts/raw/master/eClassGradeCalculator.user.js)

Calculates your grade based on "Relative Weight" and "Contribution to course total" columns. Sometimes these columns are populated without your grade being revealed, but doing easy math gets us the answer. Probably could be easily extended to work with Moodle in general, but I don't care.

### githubQuickDelete.user.js [![Install](https://img.shields.io/badge/userscript-install-blue)](https://github.com/Mattwmaster58/userscripts/raw/master/githubQuickDelete.user.js)

Helps you delete GitHub repos faster. The script changes the action of the delete button to instantly delete a given repo.

#### WARNING

Don't actually use this.

GitHub UI designers designed the delete dialog the way they did for a reason. If you use this, you're bypassing that and making it easier to accidentally delete a repo (It's not always easy to get it back!). Please be aware of that.

#### Demo

### ytCompilationMusicControls.user.js [![Install](https://img.shields.io/badge/userscript-install-blue)](https://github.com/Mattwmaster58/userscripts/raw/master/ytCompilationMusicControls.user.js)

Parses a tracklist from a compilation video description to enable usage of media keys to seek tracks within the video (ie, the next/prev buttons on your keyboard). The now playing information is also set. Also include a PoC for shuffling the tracks in the compilation video.

## userstyles

### redditCollapseSidebar.user.css

Collapses the sidebar when your screen gets to narrow (configurable)
