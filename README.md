### eClassGradeCalculator.user.js

Calculates your grade based on "Relative Weight" and "Contribution to course total" columns. Sometimes these columns are populated without your grade being revealed, but doing easy math gets us the answer. Probably could be easily extended to work with moodle in general, but I don't care.

### githubQuickDelete.user.js
[![Install](https://img.shields.io/badge/userscript-install-blue)](https://github.com/Mattwmaster58/github-quick-delete/raw/master/githubQuickDelete.user.js)

A simple [userscript](https://greasyfork.org/en/help/installing-user-scripts) to help you delete GitHub repos faster. The script changes the action of the delete button to instantly delete a given repo.

#### WARNING

Don't actually use this.

GitHub UI designers designed the delete dialog the way they did for a reason. If you use this, you're bypassing that and making it easier to accidentally delete a repo (It's not always easy to get it back!). Please be aware of that.
